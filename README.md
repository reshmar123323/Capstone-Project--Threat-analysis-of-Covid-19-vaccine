Life Threatening Prediction due to the adverse effects of Covid-19 Vaccination

The COVID-19 pandemic affected people of all ages around the world. Therefore, this vaccine was developed and made publicly available in an unprecedented era. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System; is a national early warning system for detecting potential safety issues with vaccines approved in the United States.
VAERS is a passive reporting system. That is, individuals submit a report of their experience to the CDC and FDA. VAERS is not designed to determine if a vaccine has caused health problems, but it has abnormal or unexpected patterns of adverse events that may indicate potential vaccine safety problems. Especially useful for detecting. In this way, VAERS can provide the CDC and FDA with valuable information that additional work and evaluation is required to further assess potential safety concerns.

The main purposes of VAERS are:
Detect new, abnormal or rare adverse events of the vaccine. Monitor the increase of known adverse events.
Identify potential patient risk factors for certain types of adverse events. Assess the safety of the newly approved vaccine.
Identify and address potential reporting clusters (for example, Time or Geographical or Product / Batch / Batch Specific Adverse Event Reports that appear to be localized).
Detects persistent safe use issues and management errors.

Business Objective:
1.	The goal of this project is to describe life threatening events after COVID-19 vaccination in patients.
2.	In addition, we are going to identify factors associated with more severe adverse effects.


Approach:
1.	Data Understanding
2.	Data Pre-Processing
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis
4.	Data Mining
5.	Model Building
6.	Model Evaluation
7.	Model Optimization
 
This is a Healthcare domain in which we are trying to predict as what is the possibility of death post vaccination. There are 49021 records and there are 51 features and 1 column(died) which contains the information of what is the possibility of death post vaccination.
